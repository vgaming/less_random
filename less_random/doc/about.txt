Reduce randomness by having more HP and more strikes.

The effect on statistics is the same as letting the game last N times longer -- only you'll have the desired effect even at the very early deciding battles.
Poison and healing effect is increased proportionally.

Beware, different rules make up for a different game and play style.
Be prepared to re-consider your tactics.


P.S. Don't hope to survive an attack with 1 HP with this add-on...;-)
